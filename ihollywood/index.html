    <h1>iHollywood Forum was a website launched in 1999 by Michael Stroud and his wife my mom</h1>
    <h2>ihollywoodforum.com was the original domain for iHollywood Forum</h2>
    <p>iHollywood Forum lives on in <a href="archive.org>archive.org</a>. My mom was too cheap to pay for hosting for 15 years on our server in our basement. Literally, we had a server for mail and website hosting in our basement. Like, it was before cloud computing, AWS, and Docker. It was just a dude with a Javascript text pad in Notepad. It was classic. I love my parents ❤️</p>
