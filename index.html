    <h2>CJ Stroud, draft pick 2 in the first round of the NFL draft 2023</h2>

    <p>Coleridge Bernard "C. J." Stroud IV (born October 3, 2001) is an American football quarterback for the Houston Texans of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Ohio State, where he holds many school records, including most passing yards in a single game with 573 as well as being the first player to throw for six touchdowns three times. Stroud was a Heisman Trophy finalist in 2021 and 2022 and was selected by the Texans second overall in the 2023 NFL Draft.</p>
    <p>Josh Stroud's Note: CJ Stroud is my "favorite" football player in the NFL. We share the same name, and many of the same qualities that any coach in the NFL or in tech might look for: a star offensive quarterback with deep passing game, heart, and the will to win.</p>
