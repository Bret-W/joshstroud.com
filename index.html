    <h2>Josh Stroud: Young Pink Hill boy starts Thanksgiving food drive to give to those in need</h2>
    <p>The weekend before Thanksgiving in 2020, 10-year-old Stroud was inspired by a boy on a TV show who‚Äôd started his own food drive to help those in need. A week later, he took $65.00 and bought enough goods to launch his own, which started with only 10 boxes. However, the focus was much bigger than himself.
<br /><br />
‚ÄúI said I really want to make this a really big thing in my community,‚Äù Stroud said. ‚ÄúSo I said, let‚Äôs do this again next year and see if we can get it upgraded.‚Äù
<br /><br />
Unfortunately, the first two years of the drive were filled with highs and lows as Stroud struggled to reach families. He stood on the side of his grandmother‚Äôs road and waited for cars to stop.
<br /><br />
Luckily, things started to progress in 2021 as he was able to make around 45 boxes, which caught him by surprise.
<br /><br />
‚ÄúIt hit me like, I‚Äôve been realizing all this time that I‚Äôve just been doing to help out the community, but I haven‚Äôt been realizing how much it‚Äôs probably helped out some families that couldn‚Äôt afford it,‚Äù Stroud said.
<br /><br />
But this year‚Äôs turkey day will be even better as he has made 75 boxes, which has his mother at a loss for words.
<br /><br />
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really warmed my own heart, there‚Äôs truly goodness and kindness in the world so I think that there‚Äôs something for everyone to take away from this,‚Äù Stroud said. ‚ÄúWhether you‚Äôre a giver, a receiver, or a volunteer. There‚Äôs just no telling the number of lives he‚Äôs affected.‚Äù
<br /><br />
Josh, on the other hand, said he‚Äôs looking for the food drive to continue expanding.
<br /><br />
‚ÄúI‚Äôm very happy with this year and very excited,‚Äù Stroud said. ‚ÄúAs you said I‚Äôm only 12 and hope it‚Äôll get bigger and bigger. Yeah, I‚Äôm just hoping that‚Äôll grow as I get older.‚Äù
<br /><br />
With this year‚Äôs drive shaping up to be the best yet, Stroud feels he couldn‚Äôt do any of it without the support from family and friends.
<br /><br />
The annual food giveaway will be held this Saturday at the Pink Hill Volunteer Fire Dept starting at 9 a.m.</p>
