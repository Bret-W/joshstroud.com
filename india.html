<br />When I was 22, I bought a one way ticket to India. I had recently read the biography of Steve Jobs, the famous founder and CEO of Apple. I was inspired by Jobs' adventure to travel India in search of enlightenment and wanted to do the same in a modern way.
<br />I spent my first months visiting tourist sites, backpacker hangouts, and reading every day about yoga, startups, and finding your purpose as a young person. I decompressed from my days as a student at UC Berkeley studying engineering and design, and met many folks from many walks of life which inspired me to a path of purpose.
<br />
<br />I read books every day while traveling using a Google Nexus 7 Android tablet.
<br />Several months in, I met a master yogi named "White Baba" through an introduction from a mutual friend. I traveled with White Baba to his native village, and learned the ways of the sadhu, a Hindu ascetic who renounces the world in search of spiritual enlightenment. I met White Baba's family at a compound 50 miles from Varanasi. White Baba could not enter his parent's house because of his religious vows, so he waited outside while we ate dinner and drank chai.

<br />My adventure with White Baba included many visits to ashrams, Hindu monasteries, and Hindu holy sites, including the temple in his native village, and numerous shrines. For the first time, I was exposed to career spirituality: spending a lifetime in search of spiritual meaning and progress, and the world of spiritual seekers, ascetics, and sadhus.
<br />White Baba and I parted ways, and I found myself in the town of Rishikesh in the mountains of northern India. So far I had dabbled in yoga and meditation through sitting in classes in an ashram with a famous spiritual teacher and wandering the countryside with a sadhu. I was ready to "get serious" and "cinch" enlightenment in "a couple weeks," so I enrolled in an intensive 500 hour yoga teacher training at a local school Om Shanti Om in Rishikesh.
<br />
<br />I studied yoga at Om Shanti Om ashram in Rishikesh, India.
<br />After completing the yoga course, I headed to Dharamshala for my final stop on my India adventure. Dharamshala was the home of the famous Buddhist spiritual leader Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama is well known in America for his spiritual wisdom, practical insight, and knowledge of mindfulness and happiness. I visited his temple every day and practiced yoga and meditation.
<br />
<br />The Dalai Lama is a spiritual leader in Tibetan Buddhism based in Dharamshala, India.
<br />A chance encounter with an American ex-pat who lived in Dharamshala for many years led me to a small classroom across the street from the Dalai Lama's temple. A senior Buddhist monk from the temple led our class in a recitation of the Tibetan Buddhist Bodhisattva Vow: a vow to help all beings reach enlightenment before helping ourselves to do the same.
<br />The Tibetan Buddhist vow of the Bodhisattva: "Just as the past tathƒÅgata arhat samyaksambuddhas, when engaging in the behavior of a bodhisattva, generated the aspiration to unsurpassed complete enlightenment so that all beings be liberated, all beings be freed, all beings be relieved, all beings attain complete nirvana, all beings be placed in omniscient wisdom, in the same way, I whose name is so-and-so, from this time forward, generate the aspiration to unsurpassed complete enlightenment so that all beings be liberated, all beings be freed, all beings be relieved, all beings attain complete nirvana, all beings be placed in omniscient wisdom."

<br />As a young man, I took this Bodhisattva vow seriously. Fate and chance together led me to this place. I found myself in my final days in India contemplating a life-long vow of universal enlightenment, which I carried with me into my next adventures in America as an entrepreneur and engineer. I believe in this mission statement today as a central theme of purpose and direction in an entrepreneurial life, grounded in ethics, truth, and insight into the mind, the body, and the heart.
<br />Travel Photos from India
<br />Across my adventures in India, I shared many small moments with locals and backpackers who left their mark in my life as a young man. I'm grateful to all of my adventurer friends :)
