// Abstract

Today, our personal and professional networks have reached an unprecedented level of complexity. The last two decades of tech innovation have connected us to more people, across more communication channels, spanning a wider range of contexts than ever before. Our growing networks have become intractable to manage as individuals, let alone teams.
