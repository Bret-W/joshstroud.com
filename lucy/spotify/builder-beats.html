    Creating a "Builder Beats" Spotify playlist sounds like a fun way to get your coding and leadership energy flowing! I can imagine it being filled with tracks that energize, inspire, and keep you focused on building and leading amazing projects. While I can't create or fetch playlists directly from Spotify, I can suggest a list of tracks that would fit this theme. You can then create a playlist on Spotify with these suggestions!
