    <h1>Richard Hanbury, Founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.sana.io/">Sana Health</a></h1>

    <p>Richard developed Sana’s neuromodulation platform to eradicate his own life-threatening pain problem following a spinal cord injury from a jeep crash in Yemen in 1992. It is now his life's mission to help as many people as possible find relief. He previously founded a software startup, and before that worked for McKinsey. He has spent 28 years developing Sana’s technology from the original benchtop device to the current device undergoing clinical trials.

    <p>
        What he most loves about leading Sana Health is hearing story after story from Sana users who say that Sana gave them their life back. Richard obtained an MBA from the Wharton School and a Diploma in Law from College of Law London.
